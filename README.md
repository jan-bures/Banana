# B.A.N.A.N.A. - Click-through blocker
B.A.N.A.N.A. (Blocking All Non-Accessible Navigation Actions) is an **experimental** plugin for blocking click-through
on UITK and IMGUI mod windows.

## Prerequisites
- For now requires [UITK for KSP 2](https://github.com/jan-bures/UitkForKsp2) to be installed.
  This will most likely be changed later to a soft dependency to allow use with just IMGUI.
